Version 2024.8.5

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Bug Fixes ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

- ^[Gyroscope Aiming](colored: 'white'): Fixed issue where flipping your device upside down reversed aiming with the gyroscope.

- ^[Physical Keyboard](colored: 'white'): Fixed issue where you could not type in the console opening it using the ~ key.

Open the console using the ^[~](colored: 'white') key on the keyboard to enter cheats and other commands. The fixed text size only show up on fresh installs for now. You can manually update this by editing the ^[gzdoom.ini](colored: 'gray') in the Preferences folder of GenZD, by setting ^[con_scale=4](colored: 'gray').

You can now view this ^[What's New](colored: 'white') content in the ^[Help](colored: 'white') screen, by tapping on the ^[What's New](colored: 'white') button in the upper left corner.

Version 2024.8.3
 
^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Better iPad Support ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

- Improved controls with Magic Keyboard + Touchpad or Physical Mouse:
  - Fixed mouse movement using a touch pad or physical mouse.
  - Interacting with a physical keyboard will automatically hide touch controls, and touching the screen will show the touch screen controls again.

If you're updating the app and playing with an iPad for the first time, you may need to manually map the primary tap or left click button to the Fire/Attack control.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Touch Controller ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

- You can now shoot and aim at the same time by ^[touch and dragging](colored: 'yellow') a button that is on the aiming side (right side).
- Removed the double-tap to shoot option because the above method to shoot and aim is more intuitive.
- Disable the Move/Aim overlay guide: Now a configurable option to disable the Move/Aim guidance overlay that's displayed if you do not interact with the screen. This is displayed once when running the app but now there's an option to disable it completely.
- Joystick Deadzone: If you find the movement joystick too sensitive, there's now an option "Movement Joystick Deadzone" to adjust this.

Gyroscope aimimg is on by default, and can be enabled/disabled in the Control Options screen. You can also adjust the gyroscope sensitivity here as well.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Miscellaneous ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

I re-did the internals of the control option settings, and your previously saved settings may be reset back to the defaults. This will not happen in future updates, and I apologize for the inconvenience.
