^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Welcome to](colored: 'cyan') ^[GenZD](colored: 'red')! ^[ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

^[GenZD](colored: 'white') is an implementation of the ^[open-source](colored: 'orange') ^[idTech 1](colored: 'white') game engine. 

A source port is able to read the original game files and ^[render the game using modern technology](colored: 'white'). The game engine can be rendered in ^[full 3D](colored: 'white') using the latest 3D graphics hardware and drivers. ^[GenZD](colored: 'white')  uses ^[Metal](colored: 'blue') to render its graphics through MoltenVK and the Vulkan API.

^[GenZD](colored: 'white') also supports "^[MODS](colored: 'orange')", which further extends capabilities beyond the original game engine, like adding ^[graphical and sound enhancements](colored: 'white') as well as ^[new gameplay elements and behaviors](colored: 'white'). 

Note that ^[GenZD](colored: 'white') does NOT contain any game files and you must provide the necessary files by placing them in the ^[GenZD folder](colored: 'yellow') using the Files app.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ  Quick Start ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

To start a game, you need to create a ^[Launch Configuration](colored: 'white').

A ^[Launch Configuration](colored: 'white') requires that you select a ^[base game file](colored: 'white') and optionally add any other files (^[mods](colored: 'white')) you wish to load. You can save this configuration to use for later.

To create a ^[new launch configuration](colored: 'white'):

* Tap on the + button in the upper left corner to add a new launch configuration

* ^[Tap on a file](colored: 'white') on the left column under ^[Select the base game file](colored: 'yellow') to select it.

* You can optionally select other files to load such as mods on the right column, under ^[External Files/Mods](colored: 'yellow'). See the ^[Adding WAD files and mods](colored: 'cyan') section below on how to do this.

* Tap the ^[Save launch config](colored: 'yellow') button to save the configuration.

* You're given an option to change the load order of mods in the next screen. Tap ^[Save Launch Configuration](colored: 'yellow') to save the configuration and give it a descriptive name.
 
* Tap the saved launch configuration from the Laucher Configuration list to start the game.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Adding WAD files and mods ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

In the ^[Files](colored: 'yellow') app on your iOS device, under ^[On my iPhone](colored: 'yellow') or ^[On my iPad](colored: 'yellow') location, you should see a ^[GenZD](colored: 'yellow') folder. You can add files here by:

- ^[Downloading files in Safari on your iOS device](colored: 'white') and moving them to the GenZD folder.

- ^[Using AirDrop](colored: 'white') from another Mac, iPhone or iPad, and choosing ^[Save to Files](colored: 'yellow'), and then save to your GenZD folder.

- ^[Transferring files](colored: 'white') using the ^[Finder](colored: 'yellow') on the Mac, or ^[iTunes](colored: 'yellow') on Windows.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ More on Launch Configurations ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

GenZD requires a base game, or "^[IWAD](colored: 'white')", at the bare minimum to start a game. This is usually the main game WAD, and these can be purchased on popular game stores online.

Some IWADs are ^[total conversions](colored: 'white'), or TCs that function as standalone games as well. The tutorial included with GenZD is an example of this.

When creating a new ^[Launch Configuration](colored: 'white'), the left column shows a list of files that are possible IWADs. Note that it only looks for file types matching .iwad, .ipk3, and .wad so some files here might not be IWADs.

Once selected, you have the option of launching the game right away using the ^[Launch without saving](colored: 'yellow') button, or you can further customize the game by selecting external mod files to add. See the ^[External files/mods](colored: 'yellow') section for this.

Here are the other options you can choose after selecting an IWAD on this pane:

- ^[Save launch config](colored: 'yellow'): Save this configuration for use later. If you added a lot of mods and configured the load order, this is handy so that you don't have to configure them every time.

- ^[Back](colored: 'yellow'): Go back to selecting the base game again.

- ^[Multiplayer Options](colored: 'yellow'): This is still largely experimental; feel free to try it out!

- ^[Launch without saving](colored: 'yellow'): Launch GenZD with the configuration right away without saving. Might be useful if you're just testing things out.
 
^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Saving Launch Configurations ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

When saving a ^[Launch Configuration](colored: 'white'), you'll see an additional screen that will let you customize the ^[load order](colored: 'white') of the mods you selected.

If you're loading a lot of mods, mod files need to be loaded in the right order, or the game may not start. The general rule of thumb is that maps are loaded before other files, but check the mod's instructions on how to load them.

You can reorder the loading order by dragging the mod files with your finger on the ^[Save Launch Configuration](colored: 'yellow') screen.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Game Controller Support ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

Game controllers are supported: mFi, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch.

Connecting a game controller will disable the touch screen controls.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ In-Game Operation ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')
