^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Welcome to](colored: 'cyan') ^[GZDOOM](colored: 'red') ^[for](colored: 'cyan') ^[iOS](colored: 'green')! ^[ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') is a ^[source port](colored: 'orange') of what's known as the ^[idTech 1](colored: 'white') game engine, the most notable game from this being, of course, ^[Doom](colored: 'red'). ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') is the work of the ^[ZDoom, GZDoom teams and many community contributors](colored: 'orange').

A source port is able to read the original game files and ^[render the game using modern technology](colored: 'white'). The game engine can be rendered in ^[full 3D](colored: 'white') using the latest 3D graphics hardware and drivers. ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') for iOS is using ^[Metal](colored: 'blue') to render its graphics through moltenVK and the Vulkan API.

^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') also supports ^[mods](colored: 'orange'), which further extends capabilities beyond the original game engine, like adding ^[graphical and sound enhancements](colored: 'white') as well as custom behavior through scripting. One of the most notable and popular mods is ^[Brutal Doom](colored: 'red'), which ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') fully supports and is my personal favorite (and the reason why I ported this to iOS).

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ  Quick Start ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

To start a game, ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') just needs a ^[base game file](colored: 'white').

^[Tap on a file](colored: 'white') on the left column under ^[Select the base game file](colored: 'yellow') to select it.

A free community-developed game called ^[Freedoom](colored: 'white) is included with ^[GZDoom](colored: 'red'), named ^[freedoom.wad](colored: 'yellow')

You can optionally select other files to load such as mods on the right column, under ^[External Files/Mods](colored: 'yellow'). If you have an official  See the ^[Adding WAD files and mods](colored: 'cyan') section below on how to do this.

Tap the ^[Launch GZDoom](colored: 'red') button to launch the game.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Adding WAD files and mods ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

In the ^[Files](colored: 'yellow') app on your iOS device, under ^[On my iPhone](colored: 'yellow') or ^[On my iPad](colored: 'yellow') location, you should see a ^[GZDoom](colored: 'yellow') folder. You can add files here by:

- ^[Downloading files in Safari on your iOS device](colored: 'white') and moving them to the GZDoom folder.

- ^[Using AirDrop](colored: 'white') from another Mac, iPhone or iPad, and choosing ^[Save to Files](colored: 'yellow'), and then save to your GZDoom folder.

- ^[Transferring files](colored: 'white') using the ^[Finder](colored: 'yellow') on the Mac, or ^[iTunes](colored: 'yellow') on Windows.

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Selecting the base game (iwad, ipk3) ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

GZDoom requires a base game, or "^[IWAD](colored: 'white')", at the bare minimum to start a game. This is usually the main game WAD such as "^[doom.wad](colored: 'white')" or "^[doom2.wad](colored: 'white')". Most mods require the ^[full-version](colored: 'white') of the WAD (not the free shareware version). You can purchase these on [Steam](https://steampowered.com) or [GOG](https://gog.com), or if you had the original retail versions on floppy disk or CD-ROM.

Most Doom mods use doom2.wad as the base game.

You can also use IWADs from other compatible games, such as Hexen and Heretic. [View the wiki for a more complete list](https://zdoom.org/wiki/IWAD) of supported games.

Some IWADs are ^[total conversions](colored: 'white'), or TCs that function as standalone games as well.

In the ^[Launcher](colored: 'yellow') tab of the GZDoom app, the left column shows a list of files that are possible IWADs. Note that it only looks for file types matching .iwad, .ipk3, and .wad so some files here might not be IWADs.

Once selected, you have the option of launching the game right away using the ^[Launch GZDoom](colored: 'yellow') button, or you can further customize the game by selecting external mod files to add. See the ^[External files/mods](colored: 'yellow') section for this.

Here are the other options you can choose after selecting an IWAD on this pane:

- ^[Multiplayer Options](colored: 'yellow'): This is still largely experimental so use at your own risk.

- ^[Save config](colored: 'yellow'): Save this configuration for use later. If you added a lot of mods and configured the load order, this is handy so that you don't have to configure them every time.

- ^[Back](colored: 'yellow'): Go back to selecting the base game again.

- ^[Launch GZDoom](colored: 'yellow'): Launch GZDoom and start fragging!
