^[°°±±²²ÛÛ Welcome to](colored: 'cyan') ^[GZDOOM](colored: 'red') ^[for](colored: 'cyan') ^[iOS](colored: 'green')! ^[ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') is a ^[source port](colored: 'orange') of what's known as the ^[idTech 1](colored: 'white') game engine, the most notable game from this being, of course, ^[Doom](colored: 'red'). ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') is the work of the ^[ZDoom, GZDoom teams and many community contributors](colored: 'orange').

A source port is able to read the original game files and ^[render the game using modern technology](colored: 'white'). The game engine can be rendered in ^[full 3D](colored: 'white') using the latest 3D graphics hardware and drivers. ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') for iOS is using ^[Metal](colored: 'blue') to render its graphics through moltenVK and the Vulkan API.

^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') also supports ^[mods](colored: 'orange'), which further extends capabilities beyond the original game engine, like adding ^[graphical and sound enhancements](colored: 'white') as well as custom behavior through scripting. One of the most notable and popular mods is ^[Brutal Doom](colored: 'red'), which ^[GZDoom](colored: 'white') fully supports and is my personal favorite (and the reason why I ported this to iOS).

^[°°±±²²ÛÛ  Quick Start ÛÛ²²±±°°](colored: 'cyan')

A free community-developed game called ^[Freedoom](colored: 'white) is included with ^[GZDoom](colored: 'red'), named ^[freedoom.wad](colored: 'yellow')
